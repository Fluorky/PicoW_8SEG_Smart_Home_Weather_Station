# PicoW 8SEG Smart Home Weather Station
Weather station integrated with a smart home system

Project is based on my other project https://github.com/Fluorky/8SEG-PICOW-THERMOMETER/
Real time thermometer using PicoW, 8 SEG display and internal thermal sensor.  
To use this program you must create file config.py in picoWfiles
with example contents:

wifi_ssid = "ssid"  
wifi_password = "password"  

Wi-fi network what you want to use must be 2.4GHz network, because the Raspberry Pico W don't have 5GHz wi-fi module.  
Next you must upload folder contents picoWfiles to Raspberry Pico W.

To upload project to pico you can use upload_to_pico.py python script.

To see how it works and how it connects, please watch "8SEG_PICOW_THERMOMETER_movie.mp4" and view
"8SEG_PICOW_THERMOMETER_Photo.jpg." in .movie folder.
